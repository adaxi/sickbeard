Description: PVR application that manages your TV shows.
 Sick Beard is a PVR for newsgroup users (with limited torrent support). 
 It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows and when they are 
 posted it downloads them, sorts and renames them, and optionally generates
 metadata for them. It currently supports NZBs.org, NZBMatrix, NZBs'R'Us, 
 Newzbin, Womble's Index, NZB.su, TVTorrents and EZRSS and retrieves show 
 information from theTVDB.com and TVRage.com.
